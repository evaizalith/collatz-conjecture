# collatz-conjecture
A script that attempts to solve the [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture). 

## Usage 
Run this script with `python collatz.py <n> <sequence>`

The script will check to see if all numbers up to **n** will eventually reach 1 when recursively passed to the Collatz function. If **sequence** > 0, then the script will display the full Collatz sequence of each number.
